===============
Getting Started
===============

Archspec is a minimal-size python package that makes it easier to work with
various aspects of a system architecture like CPU, network fabrics, etc.
by providing:

* A set of human-understandable names for each entity
* Well defined APIs to query properties from objects or compare them


.. note::

    This project grew out of `Spack <https://spack.io/>`_ and is currently
    under active development. At present it only models CPU
    microarchitectures but extensions to other aspects are expected in the future.


-------------------
System requirements
-------------------

Archspec needs the following software:

.. list-table::
    :align: center

    * - Python
      - 2.7 or 3.5+
    * - `six <https://pypi.org/project/six/>`_
      - ^1.13.0
    * - `click <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/>`_
      - >=7.1.2,<8.0

It is a multiplatform project and currently works on linux and MacOS.
Porting to Windows is expected in the future.

----------------------
Installation from PyPI
----------------------

Archspec is published on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ so to install
any release you can simply use ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install archspec[==<required-release>]
    $ python -c "import archspec; print(archspec.__version__)"
    0.1.1

This is the simplest way to install the package and getting
started using it.

.. TODO: Recommend using ``pip``?

---------------------------------
Installing from GitHub Repository
---------------------------------

Installing Archspec from a clone of its GitHub Repository
requires `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_. The
preferred method to install this tool is via
its custom installer outside of any virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

You can refer to `Poetry's documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_
for further details or for other methods to install it.
Once ``poetry`` is available we can proceed with cloning the repository
and installing Archspec:

.. code-block:: console

    $ which poetry
    /home/user/.poetry/bin/poetry

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/archspec/archspec.git
    $ cd archspec

    $ poetry install --no-dev

      - Installing click (7.1.2)
      - Installing six (1.15.0)
      - Installing archspec (0.1.1)

    $ poetry run python -c "import archspec; print(archspec.__version__)"
    0.1.1

Poetry manages virtual environments for the user. Using ``poetry run`` is
just one of the possibility offered by this tool, for further options
you can refer to `its documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs>`_.

Install Development Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install Archspec with its development dependencies you just
need to omit the ``--no-dev`` option from the commands shown
above:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/archspec/archspec.git
    $ cd archspec

    $ poetry install
    Installing dependencies from lock file


    Package operations: 21 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals

      [...]
      - Installing pytest (4.6.9)
      - Installing jsonschema (3.2.0)
      - Installing pytest-cov (2.8.1)
      - Installing archspec (0.1.1)

At this point you can run unit-tests, linters or other checks. When
developing we recommend to use Python ^3.6 so that the latest versions
of each development tool can be used:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run pytest
